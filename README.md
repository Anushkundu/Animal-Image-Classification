# Effective Deep Learning Approached for Animal Classification.
The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for the classification of various animal species from images. 
Furthermore, using the power of transfer learning, this research sought to create a sophisticated multi-class classification system capable of distinguishing and categorizing different animal species based on their visual features.
