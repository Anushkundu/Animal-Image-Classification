# Effective Deep Learning Approached for Animal Classification.
The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for the classification of various animal species from images. 

Furthermore, using the power of transfer learning, this research sought to create a sophisticated multi-class classification system capable of distinguishing and categorizing different animal species based on their visual features.

A key component of this thesis was the evaluation and implementation of transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning involved using pre-trained models as a starting point, which significantly reduced the time and computational resources required for training, while potentially improving the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

A comparative analysis of various pre-trained models, such as those based on deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), was conducted.

This analysis focused on different aspects of the models, including architecture choice, fine-tuning strategies, and the impact of various layers and weights on the classification task.

The models were assessed based on multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. By exploring these dimensions, the goal was to establish a model that not only delivered high classification accuracy but also balanced the trade-offs between performance and resource utilization.
